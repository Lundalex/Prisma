Paraform requires Translucent Image. It appears in Translucent Image the component and requires no additional setup steps.
For more details, refer to Translucent Image's documentation, included at:

Make sure to have Translucent Image installed first to avoid compilation errors. If you've imported Paraform first,
import Translucent Image and reload the scene to clear any errors.

Uninstall: Remove the LETAI_PARAFORM define from the Scripting Define Symbols in Player Settings to avoid compilation errors.
